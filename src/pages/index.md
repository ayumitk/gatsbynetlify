  I am a UI/UX designer and developer skilled in HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript, Adobe Creative Suite and Sketch as well as template platforms including Wordpress. My extensive experience and background in graphic design allow me to bridge the gap between design and development to create the most beautiful, and highly functional, websites and mobile apps. I am currently the lead creative director (REMOTE) for a tech company for pet-lovers based in Japan.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
